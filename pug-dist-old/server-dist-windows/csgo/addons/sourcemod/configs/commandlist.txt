// Triggers configuration file
//       by theY4Kman
//
// So, here's the rundown!
// Commands are entered using the format "<command> <flags> <replacement>"
// 
// For example:
//	die C kill
// 
// When the player types "die" into chat, it will run "kill" on them,
// forcing them to suicide.
//
// Here are the core flags (One needs at least one of these flags to do anything):
//  R - Rcon command
//      To run this, the user must have Rcon or Root access
//  C - Client command
//      Run on the player
//      Note: only commands with FCVAR_SERVER_CAN_EXECUTE will run
//  F - Fake client command
//      Runs a networked command as if a player had done it
//  S - Fake client say command
//      Convenience flag that runs a fake client command with "say" in front of it
//      So "hi S Hi!" is the same as "hi F say Hi!"
// 
// These next flags are optional:
//  v - No variables (Disables the parsing of variables)
//      "hi S Hi, I'm %n!" will actually display "Hi, I'm %n!"
//  d - Do not display the player's message
//  f - Begins a block denoting the flags necessary to run the trigger.
//      After the letter, a block beginning with '{' and ending with '}' will contain
//      admin flags required for this trigger. For example:
//         "kick Rf{c} sm_kick"
//      This will let any admin with the kick admin flag execute this trigger.
//      If this flag is left out, Triggers will use the admin flags in the cvar "triggers_rcon"
//      If one wishes to simply have a command without permissions, use a lone 'f' character.
//         e.g., "killme Rf sm_slay %n" is the same as "killme Rf{} sm_slay %n"
//
// Yes, there are variables in this, if only a few.
// The variables are in C-type format, meaning they are a percent sign followed by a single character:
//  %i - The IP of the server
//  %s - The Steam ID of the player whom triggered the command
//  %n - The name of the player whom triggered the command
//  %u - The user ID of the player whom triggered the command
//  %h - The hostname of the server
//  %c - Begins a custom ConVar block.
//       This allows one to access ConVars besides "ip" and "hostname"
//       To utilize it, use the same syntax as for the `f` flag:
//          %c{convar_name}
// To display a literal '%', prepend it with a backslash ('\')
//
// The only comment type available is the single line comment.
// To use it, place "//" IN FRONT OF THE LINE. It will not work anywhere else
//
// Note: For chat messages, the longest a message can be is 127 characters long.
//       This includes players' names, hostname, etc!
